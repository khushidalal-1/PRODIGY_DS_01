# PRODIGY_DS_01
# üåç Global Population Dashboard ‚Äî Power BI Project

As part of my internship at **Prodigy InfoTech**, I completed **Task 01: Data Visualization** by creating an interactive Power BI dashboard based on real-world population data spanning from **1980 to 2050**. This project demonstrates how data storytelling can bring demographic trends to life through clean visual design and meaningful insight.

## üìä Project Overview

- **Title**: Visualizing Global Population Trends  
- **Tool Used**: Microsoft Power BI  
- **Focus**: Exploring population evolution, growth rates, area rankings, and global share

## üîç Key Features

- Interactive **bar charts**, **maps**, and **slicers** for dynamic exploration  
- Future-forward projections through **2050**  
- Country-wise breakdowns of **population**, **growth rate**, **density**, and **area**  
- Highlighted insight: India surpasses China in 2023 to become the world's most populous country

## üß† What I Learned

- Data modeling and transformations using Power BI's **Power Query**  
- Creating calculated columns and measures with **DAX**  
- Designing a narrative-driven layout to translate numbers into clear visual stories  
- Working with real-world, imperfect datasets and prepping them for insight generation
